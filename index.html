  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, when I was having dinner with my girlfriend at a restaurant, a waiter accidentally dropped a receipt to the floor when passing by our table.</p>

<p>I know this is just a little thing and probably had already happened to you before. But in this case, what would you do?</p>

<p>Well. For me, I picked it up, took a look at it, then gave it back to the waiter then standing behind a counter not far away.</p>

<p>And I thought that was the end of the story.</p>

<p>But one hour later, we found out that my girlfriend had left her cell phone at the restaurant, and apparently someone was trying to reach us in order to return the phone.</p>

<p>I rushed back to the restaurant and found the very same waiter waiting for me, smiling, and gave the phone back to me.</p>

<p>To remind you, this is China, a place where when you&#8217;ve lost something you are not likely to get it back.</p>

<p>I was very happy.</p>

<p>Then I recalled yet another story happened to me one night several weeks ago.</p>

<p>I was taking a walk near my apartment, and all of a sudden an old man tripped and fell onto the floor. I rushed forward without a thought to check on him.</p>

<p>Luckily he was not hurt at all, and a bit surprisingly, he was happy seeing me coming.</p>

<p>Later I remembered helping elder people who accidentally fell in China might cost you a fortune.</p>

<p>Then I thought about a <a href="http://book.douban.com/review/1133203/">review</a> of <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/4729583/">野火集</a> I read on Douban yesterday, it was the top review on the book on Douban. To quote some of her text:</p>

<p>「既然关心除了关心便没有其他的价值，不会让我快乐，不会让我安详，不会让我感悟，甚至鲜血也已不能带来恐慌，哭泣也已不能带来动容，迫害也已不能带来愤怒，你说，我关心它们还有什么意义？」</p>

<p>「于是我继续关心自己的一切，以及自己以外的一切八卦。」</p>

<p>I want to tell you that you are wrong. It&#8217;s totally okay to be selfish, but it&#8217;s not ok to be aloof.</p>

<p>If you really care about yourself, you will not be satisfied by merely stay away from everything you don&#8217;t like.</p>

<p>Because there is always something small you can do everyday to make this world a better place, and who knows when what you do will come back to you and light up your day.</p>

<p>As time goes by I find myself getting more and more serious about everything. Why so serious, you may ask.</p>

<p>Because I care.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a dream.</p>

<p>A wild, seemly unrealistic dream.</p>

<p>For the past few months, though it seemed I was making progress everyday, the dream is still far far away.</p>

<p>So I think I should make plans. Plans and actions make dreams come true, so my dream would become a goal.</p>

<p>I wrote down the goal and its dependencies using the DOT language, then I generated a huge colored tree-like digraph as desktop background with Graphviz.</p>

<p>The parts I&#8217;ve accomplished or achieved are in green color, those I am working on are in light-green, those I should pay more attentions are in pink or red.</p>

<p>Okay now it&#8217;s more like a game.</p>

<p>Next I started to simplify my life aggressively.</p>

<p>I made a list of stuffs I can&#8217;t live without, and started to think how to shorten the list and improve it.</p>

<p>I made and a list of stuffs I really don&#8217;t need, and started to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Okay now everything seems to be in proper order.</p>

<p>I realized just as there is meta-programming, there is meta-living. Knowledge-wise, information on Twitter is the most fragmented and disorganized, so let&#8217;s go meta-level, to blogs, to books, to code-reading, to actually working on the problems.</p>

<p>Okay now I understand things better.</p>

<p>I simplified my daily schedule, I reduced the number of websites I visit everyday, I pay fewer attentions to news, I unfollowed a lot of people.</p>

<p>Okay now I have a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>And now I am happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember this famous quote from Thomas Edison describing his timeless efforts on trying to invent the first commercially practical light bulb?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have not failed. I&#8217;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, found this on Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p> When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to the New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison&#8217;s life:</p>

<p>He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene  &#8230; His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor&#8217;s instinct and practical American sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>Really, I can&#8217;t say which is better, but this particular difference between engineering-types and business-types is very interesting indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just saw this on quora:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Ayn-Rand/Why-do-so-many-engineering-types-with-poor-social-skills-think-Ayn-Rand-is-great">http://www.quora.com/Ayn-Rand/Why-do-so-many-engineering-types-with-poor-social-skills-think-Ayn-Rand-is-great</a></p>

<p>It certainly makes these <strong>people people</strong> feel good by denouncing us sociopaths.</p>

<p>Well, I <strong>love</strong> <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>The Fountainhead</em>, though I don&#8217;t quite like her, thus the title of the question doesn&#8217;t really apply to me. It&#8217;s just seeing the very wording of this question and the top answer reminds me how much I don&#8217;t like most people.</p>

<p>I am a sociopath, and I am quite comfortable with it.</p>

<p>I really wish I can block topics such as <strong>People Skills</strong> on Quora.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never learnt to handle rainy days well.</p>

<p>Woke up in the morning after a late night&#8217;s work, only to find it raining outside, like today.</p>

<p>Check the time, looks like I&#8217;ve already got 8 hours of sleep. But I don&#8217;t feel energized, or fully recharged like I should. Not at all. The colors outside the window are not right: instead of a bright blue sky, white clouds, green lawn and trees, everything is gray. Colorless. No happy kids running around, no dogs or cats chasing each other, no birds singing and dancing with enlightenment. Silence.</p>

<p>The lower temperature, the lack of energy in the air, the dim light, the monotone of raindrops falling make me feel grumpily at ease. But I don&#8217;t want to rest, I want to sit at my desk working. I don&#8217;t come to this world to just stay lying in bed, I am here to make a dent in the universe.</p>

<p>I find myself lack of appetite. I should&#8217;ve forced myself to eat more this morning.</p>

<p>Storm is much better. Staying inside during stormy weather makes you feel happy, because you are glad that unlike other creatures out in the wild, you have a nice shelter with eletricity and hot water to keep you safe. It makes you feel strong.</p>

<p>But on rainy day I feel weak. And I hate feeling weak.</p>

<p>I decided to get out and go for a walk in the nearby Century Park, and it turned out to be a bad decision. It only makes me feel smaller and weaker. How can you feel stronger as a man by being forced to walk a long way in the tall trees, without man-made concrete buildings insight in this cold, dark and damp afternoon?</p>

<p>I rushed back home to a big cup of hot tea.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just learn to pay more attentions to weather forecasts?</p>

<p>But even if I know it is going to rain, what am I going to do about it?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to be controlled by weather, or other people, or anything. I don&#8217;t want to be controlled at all.</p>

<p>So next time I woke up to such weather, I shall force myself to leave my bed immediately, get the music of my morning playlist playing out loud, turn on as many lights as possible, make myself a cup of hot chocolate + coffee and take a hot shower. It shall do the trick.</p>

<p>You can try, but you will never defeat me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How long must you have managed not to light up a single cigarette can you consider yourself successfully gotten rid of the addiction to smoking? One month? Three months? Or a year?</p>

<p>For me, as a self-identified soft-core smoker, only one month into forcing myself not to smoke, already have I started to notice a lot of interesting things happening around me.</p>

<p>For a starter, I begin to notice that people are smoking everywhere. Every single one of them. Every single burning cigarette within my eyesight, with every hand holding it. Even the butts on the ground caught my attentions as well. And all the no-smoking signs. And all the ashtrays, in public places or not.</p>

<p>It is quite interesting actually, a bit similar to the effects of weed smoking, but instead of being able to focus on whatever you wanted to see, you only see cigarettes. I don’t know for sure, but maybe a better analogy is when you are so horny all you see is just boobs and naked skins and short skirts. Our brain is such a fascinating device.</p>

<p>My body is telling me that it crave for cigarettes, or more accurately, nicotine. Feeling compelled to do things is not a happy experience. As mortal human, we have already submitted ourselves to the necessity of daily dose of foods and sleep, to be added up with occasional urges of to work, to spend money, to talk to people and to engage in sexual activities. We could argue whether or not we need any more of these mental and physical burdens, to such extent that we create and cast more and more upon ourselves. Can you imagine yourself living without electricity? Without hot water? Without Internet access? To have desires is healthy, to want something new or different is understandable and can be encouraged, but what about to have addictions that we normally or naturally don’t need?</p>

<p>People generally wanted to be free. We improved our technologies on growing foods so the majority of us can be freed from being forced to stay in the field all day, we invented telephones and the Internet so we can be freed from waiting a long time for mail responses and enduring difficulties to access to knowledges, we subverted evil regimes so we can be freed from mandate taxes and bullshits forcefully posed upon us. Our flesh so fragile that we cannot endure the pressure of hundreds of meters under water, yet we’ve sent men to the deepest corners of the oceans with a depth of one hundred times more; metal is more than one thousand times heavier than air, yet we’ve built machines using these stardusts that can carry us up into the air and across the seas.</p>

<p>Occasional smoking is good and relaxing, and it helps you gain and maintain focus during work. Most important characters in Ayn Rand’s books smoke. As a man-worshipping reason-loving atheist, Ayn Rand’s notion that smoking as a symbol of the power of man being able to control fire in finger tips makes much sense to me. But being forced to do so regularly really bugs me. Caffeine too, with it we enjoy a boost of productivity, but without it we fell deeply into a state of grumpy rapidly. Why, don’t we have choices? So is there really such a thing as freewill? Or are these addictions a price we need to pay in order to fully enjoy the advancements we’ve achieved? Can we take off our helmets while conquering the stars and galaxies? Can we?</p>

<p>Being alive is a very unnatural state of existence, since we weren’t born before we arrived in this world as a conscious creature, and we will be dead and remain dead after only a couple of years of living. Time is short, maybe I should not worry so much, so long as I know I love to read books and write down random pseudo-intellectual thoughts such as this, so long as I enjoy a lot reading and writing codes, so long as I understand that there are people to love and things to hate, so long as I see there are so much to learn that perhaps one million lifetimes are not enough, so long as I believe there are a lot to fight for and fight against and I am willing to do that, maybe I should just yield to this seemingly tiny issue?</p>

<p>Or maybe I will never yield.</p>

<p>Should I?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>引自<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%B8%89%E5%B2%9B%E7%94%B1%E7%BA%AA%E5%A4%AB">维基百科</a>：</p>

<p>… 因为过分的保护与管教，构成他贫弱的体质与孤独、甚至有点女性化的人格特质。</p>

<p>三岛的作品在西方世界也有崇高的评价，甚至有人誉称他为<strong>「日本的海明威」</strong>，曾三度入围诺贝尔文学奖，也是著作被翻译成英文等外国语版最多的当代作家。</p>

<p>三岛性好热闹，三教九流之辈无不结交，好美酒，嗜佳肴，高朋满座，列位无虚席，十足是一位花花公子。</p>

<p>1944年第二次世界大战进入最后阶段，日本的处境开始急转直下，三岛由纪夫收到了征兵检查通知，判定是第二乙种体位，需要随时等待征召。</p>

<p>1945年日本在战局中已处于强弩之末的境地，三岛由纪夫终于被征召。首先前往群马县隶属中岛飞行机的兵工厂担任勤劳动员，又马上被正式征入军伍。但因为出发参战之前罹患严重的感冒，军医误诊以为是肺病，结果立刻被遣送回乡。他隶属的部队抵达菲律宾后，在战争中严重折損几乎全军覆没，使得三岛一直认为自己本应为国壮烈牺牲却苟且延活的某种遗憾心态，这可能与他生前激烈的政治主张与最后戏剧性的自杀事件有所关联。</p>

<p>虽然逃过了死亡的命运，但是1945年对于三岛来说是很伤痛的一年，8月15日日本宣布败战投降，四天之后三岛在《文艺文化》的好友莲田善明，以陆军中尉的身份在马来半岛自杀。同年10月23日他的妹妹美津子因伤寒病逝，时年仅17岁。种种打击，使得三岛陷入了人生的低潮。</p>

<p>在川端康成的帮助下，三岛由纪夫终于获得晋身文坛一员的地位，因此对他而言川端是个亦师亦友的重要人物。</p>

<p>早年的三岛始终带有女性的阴柔气质，他厌恶剑道，甚至厌恶剑道砍击时所发出的声音。<strong>1955年，时年30岁的三岛，感受到自己对于美的憧憬，开始上健身房运动及游泳，甚至娴习剑道，以期将自幼以来孱弱的身体改造得强健，让自己不再为肉体的自卑而感到困扰。</strong></p>

<p>1968年诺贝尔文学奖公布得主是川端康成，三岛在第一时间得知得主不是他，脸色铁青一言不发驾着自家跑车上高速公路奔数小时，显见未能得奖对他打击极深。</p>

<hr />

<p>看着电脑屏幕上三岛由纪夫健身前后的体格对比，再低头看着右手手心为了掐灭烟头而留下的两颗水泡，我实在无法不对这个最后敢于用刀切开自己腹肌的男人致以崇高的敬意。</p>

<p>于是默默地打开豆瓣，把《金阁寺》和《假面的告白》加入到本已够长的待读列表。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following are the notes I took while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cassandra-Definitive-Guide-Eben-Hewitt/dp/1449390412"><em>Cassandra The Definitive Guide</em></a>. I am taking a client work that requires me to use Cassandra, so I picked up this book to get familiar with it. It was a good read.</p>

<p>This article is for Chapter 1 the introduction of Cassandra and in general NoSQL. Since I am not an expert in this field, it contains a lot of quotes from the book. In fact, there are so many quotes in this article that many sentences not appear in blockquotes are actually quotes as well. Apologies for that.</p>

<p>I expect myself to write at least one more article on this book, which will be more on the technical details as described in the rest of the book.</p>

<p>全文 1238 字，从第二段开始到「但同时又多象一个神话啊！ 」作者用了 700 字添油加醋地复述了一遍影片剧情，其中多次使用排比和反问的句式反复煽动读者的情绪，并在正式阐述自己看法之前用一连串的感叹号把情绪推到高潮。</p>

<p>接下来的 502 字作者终于开始阐述自己的观点。主要观点无非是美国利用自己的力量强行推广自己的意识形态，导致战乱四起，流血冲突不断。美国有罪。</p>

<p>如果作者仅仅想表达美国不是那么完美无瑕的就算了，这点当然是对的。人是不完美的，用来规范人类行为的制度当然也不可能是完美的。但是接下来这段话露馅了：</p>

<p>「但我完全不解的是，我们这样一个有如此深厚底蕴和浓烈意识形态色彩的国家，怎么会有相当一批精英分子长年追随这些不着四六的东西？怎么会人云亦云地重复骗子自己都不信的几个概念？怎么会以做“一夜美国人”为豪？ 」</p>

<p>朋友啊，你不解不代表别人不解，你不信不代表别人不信。你不解又不赶紧想办法解，却在这里长篇大论，这种公众场合大声放屁的行为无论如何都让人不爽。</p>

<p>何况你的屁又响又臭。</p>

<p>「深厚底蕴和浓烈意识形态色彩」是最不值钱的东西，爱国主义是最好的避难所。正是有这些盲目的激情，缺乏教育的广大民众容易被别有用心的一小撮人所操纵，以达到这些人不可告人的目的。帝国主义，军国主义，纳粹都是这么出来的。</p>

<p>我们更需要的不是像你这样的煽动情绪的技巧，而是理性地去认识别人的优点和过人之处，去了解我们近代这几百年来到底是怎么输掉的。这也就是你不了解的「怎么会有相当一批精英分子长年追随这些不着四六的东西」。</p>

<p>只能说你的煽动性技巧不错。最好玩的是你在倒数第二段说道：</p>

<p>「辞藻华丽的枪稿可能还会继续蒙蔽一部分人，但是会有越来越多的人跳过枪稿，阅读正文。」</p>

<p>咦，你是在说自己辞藻华丽么？：D</p>

<p>我实在是很好奇你这样的写作手法是不是有门派有套路的。标题、开头和前半部分都很有气势，让部分容易激动的读者血冲脑门，于是在阅读下半部分最关键的论点部分时就容易不用心推敲从而对作者的观点唯唯诺诺点头称是。</p>

<p>你站在那一边，选择这样的角度写下了这样的一篇文章，就已经输了。You may win a battle, but you&#8217;ve lost a war.</p>
