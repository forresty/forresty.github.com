    Hi, I am Forrest.
  </h1>

  <p>I code. Mostly in <span class="tech">Ruby</span>, <span class="tech">JavaScript</span> and <span class="tech">Python</span>.</p>

  <p>I often teach for <a href="https://lewagon.com">Le Wagon</a>, No.1 coding bootcamp in the world according to <a href="https://www.switchup.org/research/best-coding-bootcamps">switchup</a>. I’ve traveled to Chengdu, Tokyo and Melbourne to teach 10+ batches. The tech stack we use in Le Wagon is <span class="tech">Ruby on Rails</span>.</p>

  <p>I also lead corporate training workshops, teaching teams how to code in <span class="tech">Python</span>. Meanwhile I created WeChat Mini Programs (<span class="tech">JavaScript</span>), and built a Tensorflow-based smart vending machine with <span class="tech">Python and IoT</span>.</p>

  <p>Recently, my friends and I won AngelHack’s Shanghai Hackathon! (2018)</p>

  <p>Headquartered in Shanghai, I live with my girlfriend and our bunny, Pudding.</p>

  <p>I used to work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda">Shanda Network</a> and <a href="https://same.com">same</a>, as a developer/product manager.</p>

  <p>10 years ago, I co-founded and built <a href="https://ele.me/">ele.me</a>, the No.1 food ordering & delivery platform that serves hungry people and restaurants in more than 2,000 cities throughout modern China.</p>
