    Hi, this is Forrest Feng Ye.
  </h1>

  <p>Nowadays, I make a living by coding and teaching others to code.</p>

  <p>I travel and teaching in <a href="https://lewagon.com/shanghai">Le Wagon Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://lewagon.com/chengdu">Chengdu</a>, <a href="https://lewagon.com/tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="https://lewagon.com/melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="https://lewagon.com/kyoto">Kyoto</a>, in which the tech stack is Ruby on Rails.</p>

  <p>While I am not traveling, I live in Shanghai with my girlfriend and our cute little bunny. Her name is Pudding.</p>

  <p>Recently I've also done some company trainings (teaching people to code in Python), built several WeChat Mini Programs, and a Tensorflow-based smart vending machine (IoT).</p>

  <p>I used to work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda">Shanda Network</a> and <a href="https://same.com">same</a>.</p>

  <p>Oh by the way, in the ancient past I also co-founded <a href="https://ele.me/">ele.me</a>.</p>
