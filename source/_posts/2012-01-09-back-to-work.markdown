It's been months since I put down this site, and it's been months since I left moregg to explore a path of my own.

It was a great time. Finally I was able to learn technical stuffs real seriously, covering the fine details behind each problem I encountered.

Just calm down, deep breath, and started to train myself into a hacker. It takes time, and I have plenty of time.

I learnt Ruby the hard way. I learnt Rails the hard way. I started to re-learn Objective-C and the art of iOS app development.

I signed up online courses from Stanford: mlclass, aiclass and dbclass, and finished them all.

I started to read in English most of the time, and I read a lot, Kindle is my beloved and trusted friend.

And now I am writing too.

I started to develop a taste in music. I started to learn playing guitar.

I learnt to cook.

I started to travel. More and more.

I started to provide anti-Great-Firewall-of-China solutions and technical supports for my friends,
something I thought I would never do because it would be categorized into "fixing the computer".

I started to learn how to love. Truly madly deeply. And I learnt how to hate.

Most importantly, I started to believe that kindness, generosity, freewill, bravery, audacity and all other sorts of human virtues are
the foundamentals of modern human society. Without the right values, a person with greater power can do more harm than good.

And that's why I don't like most so-called successful people in China.

And that's why I hate China.

But now, as time calls, hereby I formally announce that I am back to work, ending my gap year early since I have more important things to do.

It's been a great journey, and I think I am more than ready.

If my life is meant to be running at the speed of 180 MPH, so be it :)

Hell, I am back to work.

To infinity and beyond.
