It's been months since I put down the original forresty.com, and it's been months since I left moregg to explore a path of my own.

It was a great time. Finally I was able to learn technical stuffs real seriously, covering the fine details behind each problem I encountered.

Just calm down, deep breath, and started to train myself into a hacker. It takes time, and I have plenty of time.

I learnt Ruby the hard way. I learnt Rails the hard way. I started to re-learn Objective-C and the art of iOS app development.

I signed up online courses from Stanford: mlclass, aiclass and dbclass, and finished them all.

I started to read in English most of the time, and I read a lot. And now I am writing too. Kindle is my beloved and trusted friend.

I started to develop a taste in music. I started to learn playing guitar.

I learnt to cook.

I started to travel. More and more.

I started to learn how to love. Truly madly deeply.

But now, well, hereby I formally announce that I am back to work, ending my gap year early since I have more important things to do.

I think I am more than ready.

If my life is meant to be running at the speed of 180 MPH, so be it :)

Hell, I am back to work.
