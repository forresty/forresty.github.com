This world is full of thoughtful thinkers who don't speak out loud enough, talkative hyperactive doers who don't think enough, passive nihilistic people who hate this world and hate themselves, and mindless lazy people who know nothing but to lamely entertain themselves.

So I say, hey sexy world, I am here to make you a better place.

I intend to think out loud till I feel I've satisfied myself.
