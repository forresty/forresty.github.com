Remember this famous quote from Thomas Edison describing his timeless efforts on trying to invent the first commercially practical light bulb?

> "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

Well, found this on Wikipedia:

>  When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to the New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:
>
> He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene  ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.

Really, I can't say which is better, but this particular difference between engineering-types and business-types is very interesting indeed.
