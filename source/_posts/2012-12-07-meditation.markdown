If you need meditation in order to clear your mind, that's called finding focus / getting into the zone.

If you need meditation because you feel a little bit burnt out, that's called resting.

If you have work to do but you think you need to meditate, that's called procrastination.

If you fell asleep during meditation, that's called sleeping.

Just stop pretending how sacred it is and start to get things done.

I'd like to be proven wrong though.
