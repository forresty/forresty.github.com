If you need meditation in order to clear your mind, that's called finding focus / getting into the zone.

If you need meditation because you feel a little bit burnt out, that's called resting.

If you need meditation because you don't know what to do, that's called thinking.

If you have work to do but you think you need to meditate, that's called procrastination.

If you fell asleep during meditation, that's called sleeping.

Steve Jobs practiced meditation, Elon Musk may have done drugs, super heroes in Ayn Rand's books smoke. They might helped, but they are not why those people are successful.

Just stop pretending and start to get things done.
