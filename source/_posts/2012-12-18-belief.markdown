Just now when I was reading _[Freedom from Fear](http://www.amazon.cn/Freedom-from-Fear-Suu-Kyi-Aung-San/dp/0141039493/)_, all of a sudden a [tweet](https://twitter.com/fisio/status/276652286682464256) posted by @fisio several days ago popped into my mind.

Mind you, that tweet might hurt your eyes.

It's confirmed that [95 Tibetans](http://www.savetibet.org/resource-center/maps-data-fact-sheets/self-immolation-fact-sheet) have self-immolated inside Tibet since February 27, 2009.

Most of them are younger than me, yet they had done what they thought was right.

Once I burnt myself with a cigarette butt, trust me, it hurts.
