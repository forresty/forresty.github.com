In _Programming iOS 6_ by Matt Neuburg:

> Indeed, the whole setup reminds one of nothing so much as Plato’s theory of Forms. For Plato, this world of ours is the world of individual things, but those things derive their natures by virtue of archetypal Forms that live off in another world... it is, indeed, implicit in the design of object-based languages and has been evoked explicitly in discussions of such languages ever since Smalltalk.

I am not a smart man. I am not self-disciplined. And (yet even worse) I am stubborn.

It is little moments like this make me happy and remind me that all I need is time.

Dear society, I forgive you.

Great book BTW.
