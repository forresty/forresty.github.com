What if you have full control over your time?

Around the end of the last year, I finally found myself have a rough understanding what I want to do in this life.

Then I started to break down my long-term goals into small steps, and execute them one by one following the plan.

Apparently my most valuable asset is my time, and how well I can achieve my goals depends solely on how effectively I can spend my time. So I built a pet project code-named Sandglass to do some sort of recording and measurements on how I spend my time.

It's still very early and very rough, maybe later I will polish it and make it an online service, or maybe I will open source it, or maybe it will stay a private project forever, I haven't decided yet.

More than 2 weeks have passed since I started to take records, and some interesting data have already surfaced. Obviously I am not doing very well :)

Naturally I think, the next steps are to make changes, and measure again. Rinse and repeat.

This aligns pretty well with how you (should) do software performance optimization:
