It's so funny to watch people claiming that they are individualists, love _Atlas Shrugged_ or _The Fountainhead_, or believing in Austrian School of economics running around in groups, meeting random people on Internet, and enjoying themselves by singing Karaoke together.

I am not against Karaoke BTW.

Wait, maybe they are just not self-confident enough?
