It is unconditional.

It comes not from your brain, but from your heart.

You don't reason, you don't do logical deductions, you don't second guess. You don't calculate the ROI.

You just believe.

You follow your heart. You listen to your gut feelings.

You take risks, you make decisions and stick to them. You swallow the consequences that might follow.

You don't regret. You don't think about alternative routes.

You don't care what other people may think or say.

Forget about the rule book. Forget about skills, strategies and techniques.

Because in the temple of the God of Love, everything else doesn't matter. Not at all.

You already have the greatest pleasure that had ever and will ever exist on Earth.

What else are you looking for?

Am I wrong?
