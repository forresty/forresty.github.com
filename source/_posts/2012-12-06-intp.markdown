Just took another MBTI test, it seems now I am an INTP.

Apparently I've changed a lot since last time (roughly 3~4 years ago) I took the test I was an ENFP. I think it's likely that I've had stayed ENFPish till last year or so (while recently I gradually moved from Extraversion to Introversion and Feeling to Thinking).

But I might want myself to be an INTJ, since INTJs are more on the "doer" side while INTPs are more on the "thinker" side.

So, how can I make myself move towards INTJ?

Maybe keep "thinking" how is not the right answer, right? ;)
