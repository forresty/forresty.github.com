Just saw this on quora:

[http://www.quora.com/Ayn-Rand/Why-do-so-many-engineering-types-with-poor-social-skills-think-Ayn-Rand-is-great](http://www.quora.com/Ayn-Rand/Why-do-so-many-engineering-types-with-poor-social-skills-think-Ayn-Rand-is-great)

It certainly makes these **people people** feel good by denouncing us sociopaths.

Well, I **love** _Atlas Shrugged_ and _The Fountainhead_, though I don't quite like her, thus the title of the question doesn't really apply to me. It's just seeing the very wording of this question and the top answer reminds me how much I don't like most people.

I am a sociopath, and I am quite comfortable with it.

I really wish I can block topics such as **People Skills** on Quora.
