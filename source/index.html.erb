    Hi, this is Forrest Feng Ye.
  </h1>

  <p>Nowadays, I make a living by coding and teaching other people to code.</p>

  <p>I travel and teach in <a href="https://lewagon.com/shanghai">Le Wagon Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://lewagon.com/chengdu">Chengdu</a>, <a href="https://lewagon.com/tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="https://lewagon.com/melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="https://lewagon.com/kyoto">Kyoto</a>. According to <a href="https://www.switchup.org/research/best-coding-bootcamps">switchup</a>, Le Wagon is the best coding bootcamp in the world. At Le Wagon, the tech stack we use is <span class="tech">Ruby on Rails</span>.</p>

  <p>When I am not traveling, I live in Shanghai with my girlfriend and our cute little bunny. Her name is Pudding.</p>

  <p>Recently I've also done some company training (teaching people to code in <span class="tech">Python</span>), built several WeChat Mini Programs (<span class="tech">JavaScript</span>), and a Tensorflow-based smart vending machine (<span class="tech">Python, IoT</span>).</p>

  <p>Also recently me and my friends won <a href="https://www.eventbank.cn/event/16454/">AngelHack Shanghai Hackathon (2018)</a>.</p>

  <p>I used to work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda">Shanda Network</a> and <a href="https://same.com">same</a>, sometimes as a developer, sometimes as a product manager.</p>

  <p>Oh by the way, in the ancient past I also co-founded <a href="https://ele.me/">ele.me</a>.</p>
