I am currently available for hire.

I think I am good at Ruby, but iOS projects are welcome too. **But I am not an experienced programmer yet.**

You might want to have a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/forresty).

It's said that you can only pick 2 out of the following 3 factors in creating a product:

- Good
- Fast
- Cheap

**I will not allow myself to build bad products**, and since I am not very experienced yet so you might expect me to be **not fast enough**.

Mind you, that means the my rates **might be cheap.**

Drop me an email at afu@forresty.com so that we can discuss.
