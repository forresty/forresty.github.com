I am currently available for hire.

I can drop into your team and start to get things done immediately, or design and build an entire product from scratch.

Ruby / Rails projects are preferred, but iOS projects might be okay as well, depends on whether I like it or not.

You might want to have a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/forresty).

It's said that you can **only pick 2** out of the following 3 factors in creating a product:

- Good
- Fast
- Cheap

**I will not allow myself to build bad products**. Life is short, I pick **good and fast**.

Currently my hourly rate starts at $30.

Drop me an email at afu@forresty.com so that we can discuss.
