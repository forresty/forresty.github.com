    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Originally from <em>Steve Jobs</em> by Walter Issacson:</p>

<blockquote><p>At age 33 Mike was a millionaire after selling his stock options at Intel after it went public and was practically retired. He got impressed by seeing Apple II demo. He proposed to Jobs that they write a business plan together. “If it comes out well, I’ll invest,” Markkula said, “and if not, you’ve got a few weeks of my time for free.” Jobs took the offer and spent several evenings and some nights at Markkula’s house. For all practical purposes, it was Markkula who wrote the business plan. Markkula expanded Apple vision to go beyond hobbyist market. He visualized that personal computers will be used by “regular people in regular homes, doing things like keeping track of your favourite recipes or balancing your checkbook.”</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Programming iOS 6</em> by Matt Neuburg:</p>

<blockquote><p>Indeed, the whole setup reminds one of nothing so much as Plato’s theory of Forms. For Plato, this world of ours is the world of individual things, but those things derive their natures by virtue of archetypal Forms that live off in another world&#8230; it is, indeed, implicit in the design of object-based languages and has been evoked explicitly in discussions of such languages ever since Smalltalk.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am not a smart man. I am not self-disciplined. And (yet even worse) I am stubborn.</p>

<p>It is little moments like this make me happy and remind me that all I need is time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pigeons are cute, lovely creatures. They seem to be always perfectly harmless and peaceful. They are not created as killing machines.</p>

<p>Lions are dangerous and vicious predators. They could kill you in an instant. They are lazy, arrogant and proud.</p>

<p>However, when pigeons are caged together, at times when they are upset they might attack each other, with their tiny seemingly harmless beaks. In that case, things could get really, really messy easily, in many cases the conflicts will not be resolved until deaths or severe injuries occurred.</p>

<p>They know they are weak, so they tend to become over-protective of themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, most of us have seen young predators such as lions fighting / playing with each other on the TV. One thing they always do is they will make sure they never truly hurt each other.</p>

<p>They know the power they wield, and understand the consequences if the power get unleashed unintentionally.</p>

<p>Every time I tell a lie to make myself look better, do something to act as if I am stronger, hold back when I should stand out and move forward, I feel that deep inside my heart, there&#8217;s a tiny pigeon, afraid of getting hurt.</p>

<p>That sucks.</p>

    <id>http://forresty.com/blog/2013/01/22/project-sandglass</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What if you have full control over your time?</p>

<p>Around the end of the last year, I finally found myself have a rough understanding what I want to do in this life.</p>

<p>Then I started to break down my long-term goals into small steps, and execute them one by one following the plan.</p>

<p>Apparently my most valuable asset is my time, and how well I can achieve my goals depends solely on how effectively I can spend my time. So I built a pet project code-named Sandglass to do some sort of recording and measurements.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still very early and very rough, maybe later I will polish it and make it an online service, or maybe I will open source it, or maybe it will stay a private project forever, I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>

<p>More than 2 weeks have passed since I started to take records, and some interesting data have already surfaced. Obviously I am not doing very well :)</p>

<p>Naturally I think, the next steps are to make changes, and measure again. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>This aligns pretty well with how you (should) do software performance optimization:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don&#8217;t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you have proven that&#8217;s where the bottleneck is. - Rob Pike</p></blockquote>

<p>Mind you, that tweet might hurt your eyes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s confirmed that <a href="http://www.savetibet.org/resource-center/maps-data-fact-sheets/self-immolation-fact-sheet">95 Tibetans</a> have self-immolated inside Tibet since February 27, 2009.</p>

    <id>http://forresty.com/blog/2012/12/13/seeking-answers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been more than a year since I took a leave from a startup I helped founded.</p>

<p>After my departure, I decided to dedicate my time to seek answers to a lot of questions, the questions which have been haunting me for a long time already.</p>

<p>I want to know more about the world. I want to know more about everything. I want to know more about myself.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of life? What are my purposes of living? What about my future, the future of the people I care about, my parents and my extended family? What is the future of this country?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any idea.</p>

<p>Good thing is I know money is not my goal. Although I don&#8217;t have a lot, I found that I had enough to sustain myself for a while, so I decided to let it go, and see what would happen.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve never really played enough when I grew up, first I found myself diving into video games. Quickly I found the pleasures of them mildly at best.</p>

<p>Then I took a trip into movies and TV shows. At first I learned a lot from them, namely casual English, western culture, different beliefs and different lifestyles.</p>

<p>But soon I realized that they are the products of pop culture and driven by consumerism. The information and knowledge you can find in them are shallow at best. They are designed so that the majority of the people can grasp them. <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/07/05/on-black-mirror/">I denounced pure consumerism</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there is a chunk load of nihilism in games, movies and TV shows.</p>

<p>Then I submerged into the information overload, and found Twitter to be the heaven of immediate, fragmented, overflown information. Relentlessly I looked for and followed <a href="https://twitter.com/forresty/following">a lot of wonderful people</a>, some of them become my heroes. I observed them closely. I was obsessed with every bit of information they spit out. I want to learn from them.</p>

<p>Also, there is this site called <a href="http://9gag.com">9gag</a>, and through 9gag I discovered <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>. Where pop culture meets information overload.</p>

<p>But later I realized that <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/11/20/serious/">being a bystander is not fun</a>. And I found patterns emerged from the informations. There is a bigger picture. I <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/11/17/anti-social-at-its-best/">moved</a> <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/12/08/hacker-news/">on</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/10/15/smoking-and-quitting/">smoked and quitted</a>. I tasted weeds. I took risks and experienced a lot of mindless physical pleasures.</p>

<p>I sneak-peeked into religions, and found no peace of mind there.</p>

<p>I bought stuffs, and now I find myself heading back to <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/12/11/my-stuffs/">minimalism</a>.</p>

<p>I realized that this is an age of entertainment. To protest, I enclosed myself with books. Several times I found myself spent consecutive sleepless days and nights reading. Just DEAR (Drop Everything And Read).</p>

<p>I found philosophy. A whole new world.</p>

<p>But still, in the community of book lovers, I found a lot of people retreated into escapism or defeatism.</p>

<p>And now I am so puzzled.</p>

<p>People of the world, I have questions for you:</p>

<p>Working people who are proud of being professional, are you just believing in hedonism, working hard just in order to play harder? Are you an excellent human being or just fighting to become a really, really excellent sheep? Are you self-liberating or just enjoying self annihilation?</p>

<p>Social activists who claim that you are to make China a better place, do you really know what you are doing? Do you know how to build as well as how to pose mass destruction?</p>

<p>Celebrities in China, do you really believe that you are controlling the media, or are you just submitting yourselves to the mass, to this age of entertainment?</p>

<p>Party leaders of the Communist Party of China, have you thought about that you are mortal and just a small chapter in the human history?</p>

<p>Engineers, entrepreneurs and all the producers who are trying to push the human race forward, do you know that you might be doing just the opposite and helping the evil? Are you planning to help the people or just enjoy yourselves?</p>

<p>Everyone else, do you have a purpose of life? Have you given a serious thought about that you are going to die some day, and your time is limited?</p>

<p>Sadly for me, I found that most of my types of people are in the U.S., but my roots remain here in China.</p>

<p>I also found that no matter how wonderful a person was, when he labeled himself as a group member of whatever it is, he often degraded quickly.</p>

<p>Therefore I decided to stand for individualism and fight against any kind of collectivism for as long as I can sustain.</p>

<p>But I still haven&#8217;t found what I am looking for.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I read a lot of open source code, some of them are really nice, some of them suck.</p>

<p>Since I have my TextMate 2 set up so trailing whitespace and <code>\t</code> in Ruby files are highlighted, every now and then when I stumble upon those patterns, I find myself fixing them locally, and depending on my mood, I might send them a pull request.</p>

<p>Though I have a keyboard shortcut set up in my TextMate so it&#8217;s just a trivial task for each file, but it&#8217;s really annoying to see them coming up again and again, right?</p>

<p>When yesterday my <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/pull/319">pull request to capistrano</a> was rejected and was told by this nice guy called Roy Liu, that rather than fixing them file by file, it&#8217;s preferred to do it in batch.</p>

<p>So today I literally went through the entire project, read through the code, trying to understand them while fixing the styles. Oh man it hurts my eyes.</p>

<p>Obviously some tasks are better done using automation. Thus in a hurry I wrote this little <a href="https://github.com/forresty/ayi">ayi gem</a>.</p>

<p>Basically it clean up codes for you, and I intend to make it do this one thing and do it well.</p>

<p>Of course It&#8217;s now still very early in development, but let&#8217;s hope it will become more and more powerful as time goes by.</p>

<p>Go <a href="https://github.com/forresty/ayi">take a look at it</a> if you are interested.</p>
