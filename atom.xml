    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been using TextMate2 the moment its alpha is out, and it has already proved itself good enough for my day-to-day coding tasks.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s a problem: I want my codes to be absolutely clean, and trailing whitespaces in lines end really bug me.</p>

<p>By default TextMate doesn&#8217;t have such functionality, but fortunately after some research through the Internet, I found a solution here:</p>

<p>In a nutshell, you need to create a custom bundle with a custom command looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://forresty.com/images/textmate2-strip-whitespaces.png"></p>

<p>The following script is used to strip whitespaces, shamelessly copied from Text Bundle in TextMate:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1581221.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
[[ -f &quot;${TM_SUPPORT_PATH}/lib/bash_init.sh&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; . &quot;${TM_SUPPORT_PATH}/lib/bash_init.sh&quot;

perl -pe 's/[\t ]+$//g'
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>And that&#8217;s it. Each time you pressed CMD + S, all trailing whitespaces in lines end are automatically removed before the document is saved. Cheers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been months since I put down the original forresty.com, and it&#8217;s been months since I left moregg to explore a path of my own.</p>

<p>It was a great time. Finally I was able to learn technical stuffs real seriously, covering the fine details behind each problem I encountered.</p>

<p>Just calm down, deep breath, and started to train myself into a hacker. It takes time, and I have plenty of time.</p>

<p>I learnt Ruby the hard way. I learnt Rails the hard way. I started to re-learn Objective-C and the art of iOS app development.</p>

<p>I signed up online courses from Stanford: mlclass, aiclass and dbclass, and finished them all.</p>

<p>I started to read in English most of the time, and I read a lot. And now I am writing too. Kindle is my beloved and trusted friend.</p>

<p>I started to develop a taste in music. I started to learn playing guitar.</p>

<p>I learnt to cook.</p>

<p>I started to travel. More and more.</p>

<p>I started to learn how to love. Truly madly deeply.</p>

<p>But now, well, hereby I formally announce that I am back to work, ending my gap year early since I have more important things to do.</p>

<p>I think I am more than ready.</p>

<p>If my life is meant to be running at the speed of 180 MPH, so be it :)</p>

<p>Hell, I am back to work.</p>
