  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just saw this on quora:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Ayn-Rand/Why-do-so-many-engineering-types-with-poor-social-skills-think-Ayn-Rand-is-great">http://www.quora.com/Ayn-Rand/Why-do-so-many-engineering-types-with-poor-social-skills-think-Ayn-Rand-is-great</a></p>

<p>It certainly makes these <strong>people people</strong> feel good by denouncing us sociopaths.</p>

<p>Well, I <strong>love</strong> <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>The Fountainhead</em>, though I don&#8217;t quite like her, thus the title of the question doesn&#8217;t really apply to me. It&#8217;s just seeing the very wording of this question and the top answer reminds me how much I don&#8217;t like most people.</p>

<p>I am a sociopath, and I am quite comfortable with it.</p>

<p>I really wish I can block topics such as <strong>People Skills</strong> on Quora.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never learnt to handle rainy days well.</p>

<p>Woke up in the morning after a late night&#8217;s work, only to find it raining outside, like today.</p>

<p>Check the time, looks like I&#8217;ve already got 8 hours of sleep. But I don&#8217;t feel energized, or fully recharged like I should. Not at all. The colors outside the window are not right: instead of a bright blue sky, white clouds, green lawn and trees, everything is gray. Colorless. No happy kids running around, no dogs or cats chasing each other, no birds singing and dancing with enlightenment. Silence.</p>

<p>The lower temperature, the lack of energy in the air, the dim light, the monotone of raindrops falling make me feel grumpily at ease. But I don&#8217;t want to rest, I want to sit at my desk working. I don&#8217;t come to this world to just stay lying in bed, I am here to make a dent in the universe.</p>

<p>I find myself lack of appetite. I should&#8217;ve forced myself to eat more this morning.</p>

<p>Storm is much better. Staying inside during stormy weather makes you feel happy, because you are glad that unlike other creatures out in the wild, you have a nice shelter with eletricity and hot water to keep you safe. It makes you feel strong.</p>

<p>But on rainy day I feel weak. And I hate feeling weak.</p>

<p>I decided to get out and go for a walk in the nearby Century Park, and it turned out to be a bad decision. It only makes me feel smaller and weaker. How can you feel stronger as a man by being forced to walk a long way in the tall trees, without man-made concrete buildings insight in this cold, dark and damp afternoon?</p>

<p>I rushed back home to a big cup of hot tea.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just learn to pay more attentions to weather forecasts?</p>

<p>But even if I know it is going to rain, what am I going to do about it?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to be controlled by weather, or other people, or anything. I don&#8217;t want to be controlled at all.</p>

<p>So next time I woke up to such weather, I shall force myself to leave my bed immediately, get the music of my morning playlist playing out loud, turn on as many lights as possible, make myself a cup of hot chocolate + coffee and take a hot shower. It shall do the trick.</p>

<p>You can try, but you will never defeat me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How long must you have managed not to light up a single cigarette can you consider yourself successfully gotten rid of the addiction to smoking? One month? Three months? Or a year?</p>

<p>For me, as a self-identified soft-core smoker, only one month into forcing myself not to smoke, already have I started to notice a lot of interesting things happening around me.</p>

<p>For a starter, I begin to notice that people are smoking everywhere. Every single one of them. Every single burning cigarette within my eyesight, with every hand holding it. Even the butts on the ground caught my attentions as well. And all the no-smoking signs. And all the ashtrays, in public places or not.</p>

<p>It is quite interesting actually, a bit similar to the effects of weed smoking, but instead of being able to focus on whatever you wanted to see, you only see cigarettes. I don’t know for sure, but maybe a better analogy is when you are so horny all you see is just boobs and naked skins and short skirts. Our brain is such a fascinating device.</p>

<p>My body is telling me that it crave for cigarettes, or more accurately, nicotine. Feeling compelled to do things is not a happy experience. As mortal human, we have already submitted ourselves to the necessity of daily dose of foods and sleep, to be added up with occasional urges of to work, to spend money, to talk to people and to engage in sexual activities. We could argue whether or not we need any more of these mental and physical burdens, to such extent that we create and cast more and more upon ourselves. Can you imagine yourself living without electricity? Without hot water? Without Internet access? To have desires is healthy, to want something new or different is understandable and can be encouraged, but what about to have addictions that we normally or naturally don’t need?</p>

<p>People generally wanted to be free. We improved our technologies on growing foods so the majority of us can be freed from being forced to stay in the field all day, we invented telephones and the Internet so we can be freed from waiting a long time for mail responses and enduring difficulties to access to knowledges, we subverted evil regimes so we can be freed from mandate taxes and bullshits forcefully posed upon us. Our flesh so fragile that we cannot endure the pressure of hundreds of meters under water, yet we’ve sent men to the deepest corners of the oceans with a depth of one hundred times more; metal is more than one thousand times heavier than air, yet we’ve built machines using these stardusts that can carry us up into the air and across the seas.</p>

<p>Occasional smoking is good and relaxing, and it helps you gain and maintain focus during work. Most important characters in Ayn Rand’s books smoke. As a man-worshipping reason-loving atheist, Ayn Rand’s notion that smoking as a symbol of the power of man being able to control fire in finger tips makes much sense to me. But being forced to do so regularly really bugs me. Caffeine too, with it we enjoy a boost of productivity, but without it we fell deeply into a state of grumpy rapidly. Why, don’t we have choices? So is there really such a thing as freewill? Or are these addictions a price we need to pay in order to fully enjoy the advancements we’ve achieved? Can we take off our helmets while conquering the stars and galaxies? Can we?</p>

<p>Being alive is a very unnatural state of existence, since we weren’t born before we arrived in this world as a conscious creature, and we will be dead and remain dead after only a couple of years of living. Time is short, maybe I should not worry so much, so long as I know I love to read books and write down random pseudo-intellectual thoughts such as this, so long as I enjoy a lot reading and writing codes, so long as I understand that there are people to love and things to hate, so long as I see there are so much to learn that perhaps one million lifetimes are not enough, so long as I believe there are a lot to fight for and fight against and I am willing to do that, maybe I should just yield to this seemingly tiny issue?</p>

<p>Or maybe I will never yield.</p>

<p>Should I?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>引自<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%B8%89%E5%B2%9B%E7%94%B1%E7%BA%AA%E5%A4%AB">维基百科</a>：</p>

<p>… 因为过分的保护与管教，构成他贫弱的体质与孤独、甚至有点女性化的人格特质。</p>

<p>三岛的作品在西方世界也有崇高的评价，甚至有人誉称他为<strong>「日本的海明威」</strong>，曾三度入围诺贝尔文学奖，也是著作被翻译成英文等外国语版最多的当代作家。</p>

<p>三岛性好热闹，三教九流之辈无不结交，好美酒，嗜佳肴，高朋满座，列位无虚席，十足是一位花花公子。</p>

<p>1944年第二次世界大战进入最后阶段，日本的处境开始急转直下，三岛由纪夫收到了征兵检查通知，判定是第二乙种体位，需要随时等待征召。</p>

<p>1945年日本在战局中已处于强弩之末的境地，三岛由纪夫终于被征召。首先前往群马县隶属中岛飞行机的兵工厂担任勤劳动员，又马上被正式征入军伍。但因为出发参战之前罹患严重的感冒，军医误诊以为是肺病，结果立刻被遣送回乡。他隶属的部队抵达菲律宾后，在战争中严重折損几乎全军覆没，使得三岛一直认为自己本应为国壮烈牺牲却苟且延活的某种遗憾心态，这可能与他生前激烈的政治主张与最后戏剧性的自杀事件有所关联。</p>

<p>虽然逃过了死亡的命运，但是1945年对于三岛来说是很伤痛的一年，8月15日日本宣布败战投降，四天之后三岛在《文艺文化》的好友莲田善明，以陆军中尉的身份在马来半岛自杀。同年10月23日他的妹妹美津子因伤寒病逝，时年仅17岁。种种打击，使得三岛陷入了人生的低潮。</p>

<p>在川端康成的帮助下，三岛由纪夫终于获得晋身文坛一员的地位，因此对他而言川端是个亦师亦友的重要人物。</p>

<p>早年的三岛始终带有女性的阴柔气质，他厌恶剑道，甚至厌恶剑道砍击时所发出的声音。<strong>1955年，时年30岁的三岛，感受到自己对于美的憧憬，开始上健身房运动及游泳，甚至娴习剑道，以期将自幼以来孱弱的身体改造得强健，让自己不再为肉体的自卑而感到困扰。</strong></p>

<p>1968年诺贝尔文学奖公布得主是川端康成，三岛在第一时间得知得主不是他，脸色铁青一言不发驾着自家跑车上高速公路奔数小时，显见未能得奖对他打击极深。</p>

<hr />

<p>看着电脑屏幕上三岛由纪夫健身前后的体格对比，再低头看着右手手心为了掐灭烟头而留下的两颗水泡，我实在无法不对这个最后敢于用刀切开自己腹肌的男人致以崇高的敬意。</p>

<p>于是默默地打开豆瓣，把《金阁寺》和《假面的告白》加入到本已够长的待读列表。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following are the notes I took while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cassandra-Definitive-Guide-Eben-Hewitt/dp/1449390412"><em>Cassandra The Definitive Guide</em></a>. I am taking a client work that requires me to use Cassandra, so I picked up this book to get familiar with it. It was a good read.</p>

<p>This article is for Chapter 1 the introduction of Cassandra and in general NoSQL. Since I am not an expert in this field, it contains a lot of quotes from the book. In fact, there are so many quotes in this article that many sentences not appear in blockquotes are actually quotes as well. Apologies for that.</p>

<p>I expect myself to write at least one more article on this book, which will be more on the technical details as described in the rest of the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>对豆瓣上空军一号<a href="http://movie.douban.com/review/1009222/">这篇影评</a>的分析，已经在豆瓣上作为评论回复给原作者 ：D</p>

<hr />

<p>颇有气势的标题，足够吸引眼球。</p>

<p>开头第一段开门见山地立论，较有气势。</p>

<p>全文 1238 字，从第二段开始到「但同时又多象一个神话啊！ 」作者用了 700 字添油加醋地复述了一遍影片剧情，其中多次使用排比和反问的句式反复煽动读者的情绪，并在正式阐述自己看法之前用一连串的感叹号把情绪推到高潮。</p>

<p>接下来的 502 字作者终于开始阐述自己的观点。主要观点无非是美国利用自己的力量强行推广自己的意识形态，导致战乱四起，流血冲突不断。美国有罪。</p>

<p>如果作者仅仅想表达美国不是那么完美无瑕的就算了，这点当然是对的。人是不完美的，用来规范人类行为的制度当然也不可能是完美的。但是接下来这段话露馅了：</p>

<p>「但我完全不解的是，我们这样一个有如此深厚底蕴和浓烈意识形态色彩的国家，怎么会有相当一批精英分子长年追随这些不着四六的东西？怎么会人云亦云地重复骗子自己都不信的几个概念？怎么会以做“一夜美国人”为豪？ 」</p>

<p>朋友啊，你不解不代表别人不解，你不信不代表别人不信。你不解又不赶紧想办法解，却在这里长篇大论，这种公众场合大声放屁的行为无论如何都让人不爽。</p>

<p>何况你的屁又响又臭。</p>

<p>「深厚底蕴和浓烈意识形态色彩」是最不值钱的东西，爱国主义是最好的避难所。正是有这些盲目的激情，缺乏教育的广大民众容易被别有用心的一小撮人所操纵，以达到这些人不可告人的目的。帝国主义，军国主义，纳粹都是这么出来的。</p>

<p>我们更需要的不是像你这样的煽动情绪的技巧，而是理性地去认识别人的优点和过人之处，去了解我们近代这几百年来到底是怎么输掉的。这也就是你不了解的「怎么会有相当一批精英分子长年追随这些不着四六的东西」。</p>

<p>只能说你的煽动性技巧不错。最好玩的是你在倒数第二段说道：</p>

<p>「辞藻华丽的枪稿可能还会继续蒙蔽一部分人，但是会有越来越多的人跳过枪稿，阅读正文。」</p>

<p>咦，你是在说自己辞藻华丽么？：D</p>

<p>我实在是很好奇你这样的写作手法是不是有门派有套路的。标题、开头和前半部分都很有气势，让部分容易激动的读者血冲脑门，于是在阅读下半部分最关键的论点部分时就容易不用心推敲从而对作者的观点唯唯诺诺点头称是。</p>

<p>你站在那一边，选择这样的角度写下了这样的一篇文章，就已经输了。You may win a battle, but you&#8217;ve lost a war.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are mostly based on the third book <em>A Storm of Swords</em> of the series. I just finished this book, and want to write my thoughts down while they are still fresh.</p>

<p>I think by far this is the greatest book in the series, and according to user comments and ratings on amazon.com, the next two books seem to be not as good, rendering it probably the best among the five already published.</p>

<p>In general, in my opinion A Song of Ice and Fire is an incredibly well written fantasy series, much better than The Lord of the Rings or the Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy. I would give it a solid five-star.</p>

<p>What is so wonderful about this series is that it feels so real. Since my English sucks I would simply quote Wikipedia:</p>

<p><em>&#8230;Martin deliberately defied the conventions of the fantasy genre. The series received praise for its realism; it subdues magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. Violence, sexuality and moral ambiguity are frequently displayed among a set of over a thousand named characters. Major characters are repeatedly killed off so that readers cannot rely on the supposed heroes to remain safe and sound. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides so that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8230;However, before starting with the Ice and Fire series, Martin felt that many Tolkien imitators were writing &#8220;Disneyland Middle Ages&#8221; fantasy without grasping the true brutality of those times. Historical fiction appeared much grittier and realistic to him, fascinating him with the dramatic possibilities of the medieval contrasts such as chivalry co-existing with the brutality of war and ostentatious castles surrounded by hovels. However, where historic fiction leaves versed readers with knowing the historic outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Thus, Martin wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue.</em></p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t read this series or don&#8217;t have time to, maybe you can consider watching the HBO show <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>

<h2>What I learnt from the characters:</h2>

<h3>Tyrion Lannister:</h3>

<p>Never forget who you are, never forget your weakness. Your enemies will use your weaknesses against you, be prepared for that.</p>

<p>Having a clear understanding of your strengths and weaknesses makes you wiser too.</p>

<h3>Jaime Lannister:</h3>

<p>Courage. Fear is useless and it makes you weaker. No mather what happens, stay strong.</p>

<h3>Jon Snow:</h3>

<p>Do what you have to do and do it well. People will look up to you and follow you if you prove yourself truly reliable.</p>

<h3>Arya Stark:</h3>

<p>A girl with wisdom, courage and determination is deadly charming. 100 times out of 100 I will prefer you over the much more beautiful Sansa Stark.</p>

<h3>Davos Seaworth:</h3>

<p>This practical man gave me a lesson when he started to learn to read and write after becoming the hand of Stannis Baratheon. He said that, and reminds me that the best way of learning new things is learning by doing. He knocked me out of the illusion that I am learning in a fast pace merely by consuming up a lot of materials.</p>

<p>No, I wasn&#8217;t. So now I am trying to be a content producer while staying a ruthless content consumer. Constantly forcing myself to write something down helps me to refine my thoughts and foster understanding.</p>

<h3>Sansa Stark:</h3>

<p>People hate stupid woman.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>翻译自 <a href="http://prospect.org/article/thirteen-days-145-minutes">Thirteen Days in 145 Minutes</a></p>

<p>原作者 Ernest May</p>

<p><strong>未</strong>获得翻译许可</p>

<hr />

<p>当我了解到 Thirteen Days 这部讲述 1962 年古巴导弹危机的电影将主要通过由著名影星 Kevin Costner 扮演的肯尼迪特别助理 Kenneth O&#8217;Donnell 的视角来叙事的时候，我曾经心怀疑虑。因为在 1997 年，我在维吉尼亚大学的 Philip Zelikow 的帮助下将肯尼迪总统秘密录制的录音带转录和编辑成文本形式的时候就已经发现，不管是在这些录音带里，还是在其他相关的文档中，又或者是在肯尼迪当时的其他智囊的回忆里，都没有证据证明 O&#8217;Donnell 在这次危机中扮演了一个重要的哪怕是起眼的角色。</p>

<p>在哈佛大学出版社将我们的转录稿以 <em>The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis</em> 的名字出版成书之后，Beacon Communications 公司购买了该书的电影版权，并且电影的导演 Roger Donaldson 专程跑到剑桥来见了我们。我们聊了很久，之后 Beacon 公司给我送来了一份由 David Self 写的电影剧本。我担心我将在剧本中读到的是「Kenny O&#8217;Donnell 拯救了世界」。</p>

<p>然而事实并不是如同我想象的那样：剧本中 O&#8217;Donnell 只有一两次说了他本不应该说的话，或者做了他原本不会做的事情。O&#8217;Donnell 一向是约翰·肯尼迪和罗伯特·肯尼迪的好友，并且那些录音带的确证明了他参加了部分有关本次危机的会议。在一次会议中，他提出了一个重要的问题，这个问题随后被肯尼迪总统不断地重复提出：如果美国海军舰队在海上遇到了苏联的潜艇应该怎么办？在另一次会议里，在与国防部长罗伯特·麦克纳马拉的针锋相对中，O&#8217;Donnell 表现出了对李曼·雷姆尼泽将军的鄙夷。</p>

<p>在这里电影制片人做的更像是 Simon Schama 所著的 <em>Dead Certainties</em> （一本将一桩十八世纪谋杀案的一系列历史史实串联起来并加以修饰而写成的小说） 那样的推想历史小说（speculative historical fiction），而不是 Edmund Morris 的 <em>Dutch</em> （Morris 把自己作为一个虚构的角色插入到这本里根总统的传记中）那样的幻想历史小说。</p>

<p>但是，我们仍然要问，为什么要以 O&#8217;Donnell 的视角为主线呢？当我思考制片人还可能有其他的什么方式来让大众能够成功地欣赏这部电影，而不是仅仅满足 PBS 纪录片那样的小众市场的时候，Henry James 提出的对所有事件保持单一视角的原则让我茅塞顿开。然而采用肯尼迪总统的视角是很难的；而如果采用肯尼迪的任一个智囊──麦克纳马拉，国务卿迪安·腊斯克，国家安全顾问 McGeorge Bundy，白宫顾问泰德·索伦森，联合国大使阿德莱·史蒂文森，或者其他任何人──这部电影都很容易把约翰·肯尼迪描绘成「那个拯救世界的人」。O&#8217;Donnell 是一个合理的选择，因为他恰恰是一个处在能够接触到足够多的信息，但又不是一个有自己的政策倾向的人，甚至并不是处理这类突发事件的专家；他更像我们每一个普通人，用普通市民的思维方式去对整个危机的走向做出判断。</p>

<p>有两种欣赏这部电影的方式：一种是把它当作惊悚片，另一种是把它当作历史片。我认为，这部电影是一部成功的惊悚片。导演 Donaldson 和主演 Kevin Costner 在另一部惊悚片 No Way Out 里有较为成功的合作，而这部电影比起 No Way Out 有过之而无不及。我的电影原著合著者 Zelikow 的 13 岁大的女儿在和我们一起看这部电影的时候，自始自终都保持高度紧张，电影结束时大声对我们说：“我要读你们的书！”</p>

<p>难怪哈佛大学出版社会把我们的书背面换成 Thirteen Days 这部电影的海报。电影的版权费是一次性付清的，我们并没有对票房提成，所以不管电影成功与否理论上来说我和出版社的收入将不受影响──除非电影促进了我的书的销量，而这正是为什么出版社想要更换书背的原因。</p>

<p>但是这部电影完整地记录了历史么？我认为它没有达到十分严谨的程度。这部电影未能精确展现许多历史细节和若干个重要因素。在多数情况下，这些不实仅仅是尝试把十三天中发生的许多跌宕起伏的事件缩短到两个小时之内而做出的妥协而已。然而在两个方面，这部电影严重扭曲了史实。</p>

<p>首先，除了罗伯特·肯尼迪之外，肯尼迪总统的其他顾问在电影中的形象塑造均不成功，并且也没能和他们在现实生活中的真实形象达成一致。国家安全顾问 McGeorge Bundy 是最明显的例子。在现实生活中，他是一个不亚于肯尼迪总统的睿智的人，然而在电影里他却是一个胆小紧张的窝囊废。国防部长麦克纳马拉和肯尼迪的顾问迪安·艾奇逊只是通过他们的造型给我们留下了一些印象。</p>

<p>其次，这部电影对军方人员的刻画有误导观众的嫌疑。的确，当时总统和军方之间存在着极大的压力，军方高层一致地强硬地认为应该轰炸且立即入侵古巴，并且他们尝试劝阻肯尼迪总统的推迟军事行动时间，采用封锁和使用秘密外交手段迫使苏联总书记赫鲁晓夫将导弹撤离古巴的计划。但是电影中所描述的却是军方试图迫使肯尼迪总统无所选择只能接受他们的方案。这不仅仅是对军方人士的不公，也是对美国军人的职业信仰的错误理解。</p>

<p>关于这部电影还有其他一些合理的疑问，比如没有任何一个场景是设置在哈瓦那或者莫斯科的。电影里也没有尝试说明赫鲁晓夫决定偷偷将导弹运往古巴，以及最后选择撤出的具体原因。除了 O&#8217;Donnell 在苏联大使馆里看到的受到惊吓的年轻苏联女共产党员之外，影片中出场的苏联人只有外交官和克格勃的与美方打交道的工作人员。同样地，影片中正式出场的美国普通民众也仅有 O&#8217;Donnell 的妻儿，他们表现出来的焦虑不安将代表全体美国人对这次危机的整体感受。我个人的判断是这些取舍未必是不恰当的：克里姆林宫的场景会让观众分心，并且会引出一些这部电影无法正面回答的问题。但是其他人可能会认为这些缺失让这部电影缺乏真实感。</p>

<p>对我个人而言，这部电影对历史的不够忠实在它对这次导弹危机的三个核心要素的正确表现面前显得不是那么重要了。第一要点是，这次危机是一次关乎人类生死存亡的一个关键时刻。这部电影成功地向观众传达了这是人类离灭绝最近的时刻这样的信息，表达效果超过所有的相关纪录片和先前的相同题材电影。它精确地重现了秘密录音带上的克制却十分激烈的辩论，并且穿插十分真实的古巴丛林中处于急促修建状态下的导弹基地及 U2 侦察机对它们的低空掠过，美军的轰炸机、航空母舰和准备发射的导弹。知道这是真实历史事件的观众在离开电影院的时候将对冷战可能带来的后果有更加具体和深刻的体会。</p>

<p>其次，Thirteen Days 这部电影与其他历史资料相比更容易让我们理解肯尼迪总统在当时面临的困境。美国人在书写历史的时候喜欢带着唯我主义色彩，仿佛所有的好和所有的坏都产自美国。因此，许多历史著作甚至回忆录都认为危机始于美国政府对古巴卡斯特罗政权的敌意，或者源自于肯尼迪兄弟的铁腕强权，于是导出这次危机本可以很容易地通过对古巴的怀柔政策，或者软化肯尼迪政府的外交手段，或者接受苏联在古巴部署导弹以作为北约在土耳其和意大利部署的导弹的制衡措施这样的方式来化解这样的错误结论。</p>

<p>这部电影真实地重现了录音带中所表明的事实：这次危机与古巴的关系其实不大，而与肯尼迪所接手的保护两百五十万西德人民的承诺更为密切相关。肯尼迪没有理由相信 1961 年建立起来的柏林墙成功地消除了东面的共产党政权对把西德人民都投入他们已经人满为患的监狱的这一想法的热切渴望。恰恰相反：柏林墙本身正是东德政权和他们背后的苏联政府已经逐渐失去耐心的众多证据之一。赫鲁晓夫曾明确地警告过肯尼迪，他有意于 1962 年晚些时候解决柏林问题。</p>

<p>西德人民唯一的安全保障就是一旦苏联入侵，美国将使用核武器进行反击。任何降低这一威慑可信度的事情都可能迫使美国总统放弃西德或者引发全球范围的核战争。这就是为什么肯尼迪绝对不愿意在古巴导弹这件事情上做任何的让步。这部电影非常精准地体现了这一点，而这是许多历史文献所未能做到的。</p>

<p>最后，这部电影成功地表明了美国总统需要拥有非常高的智商和在关键时刻能够保持冷静的头脑。多年以来，电影总是把总统和他的决策圈描绘成微不足道的角色，或者把白宫当成一个被邪恶和秘密组织包围的孱弱的机构。Bruce Greenwood 在这部电影中对总统这个角色的诠释──不是一个卡美洛骑士，而是一个意识到自己的工作难度非常之大，并且他所说和所做的一切事情都可能产生非常巨大的影响。Thirteen days 这部电影表明了由谁当总统是一件非常严肃和重要的事情。</p>

<p>这部电影不能代表完全真实的历史。任何观看这部电影的人都不应该相信自己在银幕上看到的都是真实发生过的。但是这部电影足够地贴近历史，因此如果它在票房和随后的影碟市场上取得了巨大的成功我绝对不会觉得不满，因为有了它，美国和全世界的年轻人将会知道，他们所看到的很可能是有史以来人类最接近灭亡的时刻。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>剧透警告</strong></p>

<p><em>Black Mirror 第一季观后感</em></p>

<h2>第一集</h2>

<p>开场几分钟我就看出来导演想让首相和猪性交，随后的剧情发展只是顺势展开而已。对公众、媒体和注意力经济的讽刺难免用力过猛而显得做作。题材蛮好，完全可以拍成一部好电影，但是缩到四十几分钟显然太短，整个故事中的许多重要的方面没有能够表现出来，导致真实感不足。</p>

<p><a href="http://movie.douban.com/review/5340669/">http://movie.douban.com/review/5340669/</a> 这篇评论讲得蛮好，剧中没有坚决不妥协的强硬派，没有人出来呼吁保护儿童避免儿童观看直播，也没有反对党、宗教人士和动物保护组织。是的，时间有限应有取舍，但是舍得太多导致表现力不足。</p>

<p>结尾也不尽如人意。如同撒谎的最好方式不是句句假话，而是九句真话夹带一句假话一样，要表现人性中邪恶和恶心的一面和科技带来的负面影响的最好方式不应该是从头到尾不断地重复负面的内容，而应该是通过时不时地穿插善良和好的一面来提高叙事的可信度。首相从头到位只是一心想着自己的政治生命，最终也完全是因为为了自保而决定上场；首相夫人在事件当天到一年后这段时间内的表现也很难让人理解；首相的决策圈子和媒体人的表现，特别是那个冲到现场对突击行动进行偷拍的女记者的表现都有点表演过度的感觉。</p>

<p>过度脸谱化让它缺乏可信度和真实感。我想我终于对脸谱化这个词有了更深一点的理解，毕竟这个世界绝非非黑即白。</p>

<h2>第二集</h2>

<p>消费主义？这部片子是要讽刺消费主义？这集我看到一半还在猜测到底故事是发生在极权社会里还是在监狱里，又或者是在某个人类已经把自然环境破坏殆尽的未来里。</p>

<p>消费主义至上的社会什么时候有强制广告和强制消费了？比起相信这样的未来，我更愿意相信 Wall-E 里面那样的每个人肥得像猪整天躺着对着屏幕吃东西的未来。</p>

<p>骑单车象征着朝九晚五工作只为了养家户口和 pay the bill 的生活，HOT SHOT 象征着人们对出名和财务自由的向往，这些都很容易理解，但是这样的设定总让我觉得过于牵强因而难以入戏，或许是我太爱逻辑和喜欢吹毛求疵了吧。</p>

<h2>第三集</h2>

<p>对科技的恐惧。</p>

<p>是的，多数人无法完全理解科技，无法全身心地接受科技带来的变化，因此产生恐惧是正常的。</p>

<p>整个人类历史，新的科技发明的出现总是先让人产生排斥和抵制的心理，然后随着时间的流逝才慢慢将其接受，最后完全离不开科技的结晶。“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”，而人类历史上并不缺乏 witch hunt 的记载。地心说的推翻和进化论的提出并没有让人类遭受天谴，允许大众拥有枪支并没有让社会治安变得更差和让政权变得更不稳定，原子能的发现给人类带来了恐怖的冷战但是没有带来灭绝。人类会犯错，但是人类作为一个整体所拥有的智慧是我们任何一个个体所无法轻易揣度的。想要抵制科技，请先重拾钻木取火的技能。</p>

<p>是的，记忆回放设备很好，是一件伟大的发明。但是我不相信人们完全学不会理智地使用这样的设备，不会制定相应的法律和制度，不会产生新的道德约束来适应这样的变化。而如果本集中主角的行为不是在假想的未来中普遍的可能存在的情况的话，那本集就没太多值得拍的价值了。</p>

<p>血管里没有流淌 geek 血液的导演或许和大多数人一样很难真心拥抱科技带来的变化吧。对科技怀有戒心的朋友们我向你们推荐一本书《禅与摩托车维修艺术》，看完之后或许你对科技的看法会有所改善。</p>

<h2>总结</h2>

<p>整部剧集想要讽刺注意力经济和消费主义，然而在许多细节的处理方面过激和有失偏颇却反过来完成了对这两者的推波助澜，不得不说是一种讽刺。如同现在国内到处可见的川菜馆和湘菜馆，和被众人追捧的《三体》系列一样，这部剧集给人入口感觉很好，却缺乏足够的令人回味的空间。细节经不起推敲，对人性和人物的刻画不够深刻，却通过天马行空的想象力和出人意料的剧情设定，全方位地对消费者的感官进行刺激，恰恰是这部剧集高举消费主义大旗的实证，毕竟让消费者买单才是最高优先级的事项，是否耐人寻味，有没有保鲜度，存在不存在艺术价值都只是次要的问题。这样的作品，很难经得起时间的考验。</p>

<p>对一部电视剧要求这么多或许是过分了，毕竟它们都只是资本运作和迎合市场规律的产物。电视剧的受众和消费方式注定了它们或许永远无法达到足够的深度。因此从某种角度来说，把看电视剧的时间花在能够补充自己知识缺口或者能够引发思考的剧集上面或许更加值得。</p>

<p>有人说这是一部白左剧，对此我并不能完全理解，估计得多学习研究才行。我想我还是少看点电影和电视剧，多读点书好了。</p>

<p>用重辣，只是因为食材太差。</p>
