<div class="entry-content"><p>So I <a href="http://forresty.com/blog/2012/12/06/intp/">blogged about me taking online MBTI tests again</a> and found myself have changed from the ENFP type to INTP type and might become an INTJ without telling you guys what MBTI is and wtf are ENFP and INTP and INTJ.</p>

<p>Okay I know most of you are either too lazy or too busy to look into those jargons yourselves, so I am here to give a brief talk about MBTI.</p>

<p>So basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">MBTI</a> is an indicator which reflects your psychological preferences and how you perceive the world and make decisions. It&#8217;s based on the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl Jung</a> if you are wondering.</p>

<p>There are many free online MBTI tests in languages of your preferences, just Google it yourself. I took several quick ones in both Chinese and English just to make sure the results are consistent.</p>

<p>The MBTI basically categorize people into 16 groups based on 4 sub-types (2 ^ 4 == 16, hence the 4 character type name ENFP or INTJ).</p>

<p>Those sub-types are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extraversion (E) –  (I) Introversion</li>
<li>Sensing (S) –   (N) Intuition</li>
<li>Thinking (T) –  (F) Feeling</li>
<li>Judging (J) –   (P) Perception</li>
</ul>


<h2>Extraversion (E) – (I) Introversion</h2>

<p>Basically extraverts feels more comfortable when spending time with people, while introverts get their energy from spending time alone.</p>

<h2>Sensing (S) –  (N) Intuition</h2>

<p>People who prefer sensing are data oriented, they prefer to look for details and facts, while intuition people tend to seek the meaning in the underlying theory and principles which are manifested in the data.</p>

<h2>Thinking (T) – (F) Feeling</h2>

<blockquote><p>Thinking and feeling are the decision-making functions. Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it &#8216;from the inside&#8217; and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved. - Wikipedia</p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore thinkers are often perceived to have a bigger ego.</p>

<h2>Judging (J) –  (P) Perception</h2>

<p>Judging and Perception represent the lifestyles you choose. People who prefer perception are generally more passive, seeking to understand the world as it is, while judging people prefer to act, to make a difference.</p>

<h2>About My Types</h2>

<p>I was an ENFP hence I was more of a product manager / program manager type of guy. Oh, and many passionate revolutionaries are of this type.</p>

<p>Since I realized I was not satisfied with that, therefore I changed myself from E to I and from F to T, and now I am an INTP.</p>

<p>By becoming an INTP I find myself in the same group with most scientists and philosophers, but I don&#8217;t like it as of this moment.</p>

<p>Thus I am becoming an INTJ.</p>

<p>Simply put, I prefer to become more like Elon Musk than Larry Page or Sergey Brin or Albert Einstein.</p>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

<p>MBTI is just a method to group people into sub-groups. Don&#8217;t take it too seriously.</p>

<p>After all, there are only 16 groups, and even if you are in the rarest group, or you may prefer, the most elite group, 1% * 6 billion is still a very large number.</p>

<p>And there are still people like me who are well aware of the system and are willing to hack their own minds, and are capable of taking actions to change their types on demand and have succeeded.</p>

<p>Take that.</p>
